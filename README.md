# Social-launcher
Quick access to your socials.
It's a browser extension for Chrome that can help to connect your popular sites by one click.
I used Javascript and Google Chrome API for this project.
The latest version includes a new feature of your top sites.
With a nice design.

It's available now on google <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/social-launcher/ioijhmpjoplcmckgaiggcoockjijmcim"> Chrome Web Store</a>
